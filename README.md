# Diabetes

### This script uses the Pima First Nations dataset to create a model to predict whether or not an individual will develop Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 within a five year time span

This is a quick little project involving regression analysis and diabetes. I have created this project to better my understanding of not only the content currently being covered in my anatomy and physiology course, but also to practice working with simple regression models and common libraries.

So far, this model is able to predict values with a ~75% accuracy (not bad given the lack of data and size of the model, but not great).
There are several ways to optimize this model. A few I can think of off the top of my head would be gathering more data to train it on, and cleaning the data in a different way (ie... not replacing 0 values with the mean value of that column).
