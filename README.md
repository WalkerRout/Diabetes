# Diabetes

### This script uses the Pima First Nations dataset to create a model to predict whether or not an individual will develop Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 within a five year time span

So far, this model is able to predict values with a ~75% accuracy (not bad given the lack of data and size of the model, but not great).
There are several ways to optimize this model. A few I can think of off the top of my head would be gathering more data to train it on, and cleaning the data in a different way (ie... not replacing 0 values with the mean value of that column).
